# WebFlowText

## Description

As a developer I wanted to create a note app with or without having to use internet connection, so that I can retrieve the data to use later.
Some things that I learned while working on this project was using the webpack file along with using many other files in order to be able to install the application and be able to run it without having to use internet.
